C-S-3-8-1-0
convert hex to binary 1's and 0's
seth don't make sense tho, what's the deal bro,
do you even hear yourself talk man? cuz hell if we know x2

Alright stop the track... 
let's take a step back,
and go back to my pad,
Whip out my book and I'll jus learn it from scratch,
cuz this shit is good but I ain't learnin' from class,
OK, base 16, says here that's hexidecimal,
So wait, how do we make that hex to decimal,
Did he talk about that? I guess I missed the memo,
Either that, or I just missed it with my pencil,
And what's this shit about 2's compliment?
You take a bunch of 0's and 1's and then ya flip the bits?
Add 1, and whatever you get, is the negative, 
oh! I get it now, thats 2's compliment!
That's some wicked ass crazy shit,
Who's got the time and mind to come up with this?
I dunno, but I'm damn sure glad they did,
cuz lord knows I'd never think to flip those bits..
